      <h2>origin story</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>My name is Andre Willie and I am a budding web developer based in Atlanta, GA.</strong>

        I've been messing with computers for almost as long as I've known how to read. But my 
        experience with art (and specifically music) from early on has turned me into a... 
        <em>special kind</em> of nerd.
      </p>

      <p>
        There's often a bold line between beauty and function in the world of computer programming. 
        I believe that function <strong>IS</strong> form, which makes good form paramount in 
        creating any kind of software. I've made it my goal to bridge the two and somehow contribute 
        to changing the current paradigm.

      <h2>projects</h2>
      <p>
        Below you will find projects I have made. This list will grow as I continue my 
        Thinkful course and also finish some small personal projects.
